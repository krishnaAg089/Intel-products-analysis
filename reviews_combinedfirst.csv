Padi Takhu,Reviewed in India on 25 June 2023,"If you would be building pc just for gaming and slight editing or coding here and there this is perfect and the cost is really low considering what performance it gives, this CPU is by no means a low end CPU dont go gentle with that price the intel 12100f can easily handle GPUs upto gtx3060 or rx6800. Just go for it and say no to ryzen in this price for gaming."
shubham,Reviewed in India on 16 November 2022,"This is one of the best cpu in budget if you only looking for gaming.For productivity it not worth buying then you should go for i5 12400fBut for gaming and light cpu workload it work like butter smooth.I have teated some games in it , you can check it on my YT channel R tech studio."

Jayanth,Reviewed in India on 26 April 2023,Cpu stock cooler fan got broken with 1 blade in box was creating noise and virbration in cpu but processor was working fine so thought to replace but if replace it i dont know what i am gonna get with broken cpu chip so i replaced stock cooler with deepcool air cooler now it's working fine please don't buy critical pc parts from Amazon you may end up getting with broken parts worst packing
Ashutosh Aswal,Reviewed in India on 20 June 2023,"The Processor is Good & Works Fine. But The Delivery was awful, one of the blades of the fan was broken. As i already had another dedicated cpu cooler, i didn't raise a return. I expected Better from Appario. Apart From this the Processor itself works fine."

Kristopher K.,Reviewed in Germany on 31 March 2023,"Dieser Prozessor hat sich als eine gute Wahl f√ºr meinen Low-Budget-PC herausgestellt. Er bietet ausreichend Leistung f√ºr allt√§gliche Aufgaben wie Surfen im Internet und Bearbeiten von Dokumenten. Auch einfache Spiele laufen problemlos. Der Turbo-Boost sorgt f√ºr zus√§tzliche Power, wenn sie ben√∂tigt wird. Der Preis ist im Vergleich zu h√∂heren Modellen sehr erschwinglich. Ich bin mit dem Intel Core i3-10105F sehr zufrieden und w√ºrde ihn jedem empfehlen, der einen kosteng√ºnstigen PC bauen m√∂chte.Mein Patenkind konnte Fortnite problemlos auf meinem Low-Budget-PC mit dem Intel Core i3-10105F und einer RTX 2070 Super spielen. Nat√ºrlich gibt es Grenzen f√ºr komplexe Anwendungen und Spiele, aber f√ºr allt√§gliche Aufgaben und einfache Spiele ist dieser Prozessor vollkommen ausreichend. Die Installation war einfach und die Leistung ist stabil. Wenn man bedenkt, dass es eine preisg√ºnstige Option f√ºr einen Prozessor der 10. Generation ist, bin ich sehr zufrieden damit."

Placeholder,Reviewed in India on 11 March 2021,The heat fan of the processor should get upgraded from Intel. We only a single type of fan Intel provides with each of their processors. I mean look at AMD's. They contain way better than Intel. And yeah ‚ùó price is high too.
Gigi john,Reviewed in India on 25 March 2024,"I bought this i5 11400f in 2023 and still it does its job with no sweat. Well my purpose is editing in premier pro and gaming @1080p resolution. Paired with rtx 3060, its a beast at 1080p. Played competitive games and high graphics intense games like forza horizon 5 etc etc... Does its job fine. A common statement is intel processor's heat better than amd processors, well it is true. It heats very well, stock cooler not enough, my pc even shut downed 3 times when playing high end games used with stock cooler. A decent air cooler is enough to calm down this one, it is not unlocked in fact, so no explanation needed i guess. If u are gonna build a new pc build in 2024 or onwards , please consider 12th gen atleast because u can have great future upgradability chance. When said all these, i took this over 12400f because i felt this enough for my needs and it didn't disappointed me. When considering it is just an i5 i got flabbergasted by its performance fr. Many people say 11th gen is bad but i felt it as worthy for the money i spent and im not gonna do upgrades in future so... Yeah overall it is a good product and im happy with itüëç. Once again, don't even consider any of 11th gen processors if u are gonna pc build in 2024 and future because 13th gen and 12 th gen is way more future proof that this 11th gen. So yeah that's it."

Just a dude,Reviewed in Canada on 29 March 2024,"Words cannot describe the change in performance.I thought my 9600k was still a decent chip before I upgraded. Now I see although it was decent, I was missing a lot. My rtx 2080 super didn‚Äôt get upgraded this year but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll need to by next year as it‚Äôs now always peaked at 100% in games. While my gpu works a sweat trying to not burn itself to the ground, this 13600k sits around 20-30% usage and around 50 degrees Celsius in most situations.Depending on the motherboard, you may want to tweak ‚ÄúCPU lite load‚Äù settings. My MSI mobo defaulted to mode 12 and was causing overheating issues due to current. Now dialed back to mode 9, I have lost no performance what so ever, I actually gained almost a thousand extra points in cinebench by not letting it get hot.Overall I‚Äôm very happy and would highly recommend this cpu to anyone."

I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.  I have no regrets about not bumping up to the 13900k, I do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads."

Anish Roy,Reviewed in India on 28 June 2022,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!"

Mergatroid,Reviewed in Canada on 8 December 2023,"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently.

Manas ranjan pani,Reviewed in India on 25 October 2023,What's the meaning of having a new chip when it provides no generational uplift except only thing that is better than last gen is the hefty power consumption if ur fine with that this will work fine but I think ur electricity bill is gonna sky rocket 3 to 5 % uplift for 15 % more money is not worth it rather buy 13 or 12 gen with some ddr5 ram will help you more or else get r7 7700 will provide less like 10 percent for 50 percentage less power draw ryzen is just better when it comes to desktop processor in efficiency and value for money

Mergatroid,Reviewed in Canada on 8 December 2023,"I was using a 10700K. I decided it was time..well, actually I got the itch.I decided to go with the 14700K for a few reasons. One is that it's the only 14th gen part from Intel that got a significant upgrade (four more e-cores and 8 more threads, plus a small clock boost).I also don't like that the 3DFX part from AMD had caused some minor issues for people, and I definitely don't like the RAM issues I see all the time on AMD systems. If it wasn't for the RAM issues, I may have gone AMD this time. Out of all the Intel systems I have assembled for customers over the years, I have not once come across a RAM issue that wasn't caused by bad RAM.This CPU is working perfectly, and gaming excellently. Gaming benchmarks show it to be a very good CPU, and I am not having any issues with it.If you are interested in any other Intel parts, I suggest going with 13th gen as you will basically get the same part for less money. For an i7 system though, this is an excellent CPU and a half decent upgrade over the previous gen."

But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80¬∞C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80¬∞C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80¬∞c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors."

El JJ,Reviewed in Mexico on 30 October 2022,"Esper√© esta generaci√≥n para hacer un upgrade de mi ensamble Generaci√≥n 8 el cual corr√≠a a 5100Mhz y ahora simplemente fel√≠z con el desempe√±o del procesador i9-13900k el cual alcanz√≥ en sus ajustes velocidades de 6200Mhz (Anexo imagen). Us√© una tarjeta ASUS Z690-F la cual NO reconoc√≠a las memorias (Us√© 64GB Corsair a 5200 MHZ), la m√°quina simplemente no booteaba y quedaba encendida la luz naranja de la motherboard indicando problemas en DRAM, despu√©s de leer mucho encontr√© que era necesario actualizar el BIOS desde la conexi√≥n trasera FLASHBACK, una vez hecho la operaci√≥n ha sido correcta y no he tenido mayores problemas. Instal√© un radiador de 120mm cooler master lite para controlar al procesador ya que por incre√≠ble que suene el KRAKEN x73 de 360mm no fue capaz de mantener a raya las temperaturas. El Cooler Master de 120mm mantiene al procesador sin carga o carga m√≠nima entre los 32 y 40 grados y con carga m√°xima y tests pega a los 80 grados, lo cual simplemente es genial teniendo en cuenta que la temperatura m√°xima del Procesador es de 125 grados, al radiador le coloqu√© 2 Ventiladores Noctua a 3000 revoluciones en configuraci√≥n push / pull. Tengo varios laboratorios de Linux / Oracle 12c y 19c en RAC usando GRID en almacenamiento y he levantado 6 m√°quinas virtuales (3 RACs) trabajando de manera excelente y con velocidades de respuesta mucho m√°s que excelentes, por lo cual recomiendo ampliamente el procesador i9 Gen 13th para cualquier necesidad que se tenga, fel√≠z con mi compra, al momento de comprarlo el costo fue alrededor de 600 d√≥lares!!"

Lokesh Kapoor,Reviewed in India on 20 November 2023,"Just upgraded from i5 9400f to i9 14900k and super happy with the performance that I am able to achieve. It simply works buttery smooth. Large applications open like notepad apps.It heats a lot though so I went with MSI coreliquid liquid cooling solution.If looking to upgrade from 13th gen then save money because the performance is identical, however if setting up new PC then definitely go with it.My setup -MSI MPG z790 carbon wifiIntel i9 14900kMSI RTX 4070tiMSI MAG coreliquid liquid coolerSamsung 980 Pro - 1 TBRipjaws 32gb ddr5Bonus tip: If u are struck setting up ur PC then go to MSI support and they are super responsive to assist you.

Der vorher verbaute BE Quiet dark rock Slim (180W TDP) war hierf√ºr unterdimensioniert, so das ich im Bios meines Mainbords die standardm√§√üigen √ºbertacktungen von Asus deaktivieren musste. Ungedrossselt genehmigte sich der Prozessor bis zu 283W. Mit dem Luftk√ºhler ging es schnell in die thermische Drosselung. Nachdem ich die √ºbertacktung zur√ºckgenommen habe, waren es nur noch 243W. Nur noch wenige Kerne kamen an das Temperaturlimit 102¬∞. Heute habe ich dann eine BeQuiet silent Loop 2 installiert. Maximum Temperatur war bisher 83¬∞, werde es dann auch im Gaming Bereich noch testen. Interessant kann es dann noch einmal mit Davinci Resolve werden."
Scott Atkinson,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2023,"I installed this CPU a month or so ago now, alongside 64gb RAM, on an ASUS TUF Gaming Motherboard.The TLDR; It's lightening quick, and It's super easy to install. As with all CPU's care should be taken when installing and handling the CPU, but other than that it's relatively straight forward.All I have to say, is this CPU is a beast. Like its so overkill for the average user. In for gaming it is just overkill. It is the perfect CPU for me, but also for those who do intensive work loads, such as running running large data models for AI purposes.My particular use case for this CPU was to allow me to build a virtual lab to which I could analyse malware in an virtual sandbox, whilst also emulating real world hacking attacks. At present I am able to run several virtual machines with no performance issues. As you can probably imagine, this power hungry beast can get warm, but with an adequate cooling solution, there should be no issues in keeping the PC nice and cool.  I have paired this CPU with an AIO, and also additional fans for the case to ensure there is a lot of air flow to ensure that the thermals are a good temperature.My advice to anybody purchasing this CPU - go for it - it's well worth the investment, while at the same time you'll be future proofing your soon to be BEAST of a machine for the next 10 years."

Matthew K Shook,Reviewed in the United States on 6 May 2024,"This started a new PC build for me when it was on sale for $320. I haven't built a PC since 2007, so it has changed a bit since then. This thing runs hot at full load. Watch gamers nexus on YouTube. It will pull a solid 250+ watts running cinebench. I'm using an Arctic Freezer 2 420mm with a thermal grizzly contact frame and kryonaut, and it will load up to 80 degrees almost instantly without throttling but drop immediately to 25-30 degrees when the load stops. This is with ambient at 22 degrees.This thing is brutally fast, though, and in reality, outside of load testing it, I have rarely seen it go over 30% usage. The more recent i5 and i7 processors can more or less be equal in most use cases.  i5 13/14600, i7 13/14700.This processor is still top-tier and will be for a few years to come. 12th gen i-series processors were a game-changer, the 13th-gen improved on them a bit with more e-cores, and the 14th-gen is looking like a stop-gap to the next big thing.You won't be disappointed; make sure to keep it cool."
