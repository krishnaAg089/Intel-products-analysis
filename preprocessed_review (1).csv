Robert Johnson,Reviewed in the United States on 8 March 2024,"I bought this to replace my 10850k after I realized how much it was holding back my 4090.  I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.

Anish Roy,Reviewed in India on 28 June 2022,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too).

I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80¬∞C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80¬∞c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth.

Scott Atkinson,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2023,"I installed this CPU a month or so ago now, alongside 64gb RAM, on an ASUS TUF Gaming Motherboard.The TLDR; It's lightening quick, and It's super easy to install. As with all CPU's care should be taken when installing and handling the CPU, but other than that it's relatively straight forward.All I have to say, is this CPU is a beast. Like its so overkill for the average user. In for gaming it is just overkill. It is the perfect CPU for me, but also for those who do intensive work loads, such as running running large data models for AI purposes.My particular use case for this CPU was to allow me to build a virtual lab to which I could analyse malware in an virtual sandbox, whilst also emulating real world hacking attacks. At present I am able to run several virtual machines with no performance issues. As you can probably imagine, this power hungry beast can get warm, but with an adequate cooling solution, there should be no issues in keeping the PC nice and cool.  I have paired this CPU with an AIO, and also additional fans for the case to ensure there is a lot of air flow to ensure that the thermals are a good temperature.My advice to anybody purchasing this CPU - go for it - it's well worth the investment, while at the same time you'll be future proofing your soon to be BEAST of a machine for the next 10 years.",the United Kingdom,1 September 2023,instal cpu month ago alongside gb ram asus tuf game motherboard tldr lighten quick super easy install cpu care take instal handle cpu relatively straight forward say cpu beast like overkill average user game overkill perfect cpu also intensive work load run run large data model ai purpose particular use case cpu allow build virtual lab could analyse malware virtual sandbox whilst also emulate real world hack attack present able run several virtual machine performance issue probably imagine power hungry beast get warm adequate cool solution issue keep pc nice cool pair cpu aio also additional fan case ensure lot air flow ensure thermal good temperature advice anybody purchasing cpu go well worth investment time future proof soon beast machine next year

This thing runs hot at full load. Watch gamers nexus on YouTube. It will pull a solid 250+ watts running cinebench. I'm using an Arctic Freezer 2 420mm with a thermal grizzly contact frame and kryonaut, and it will load up to 80 degrees almost instantly without throttling but drop immediately to 25-30 degrees when the load stops. This is with ambient at 22 degrees.This thing is brutally fast, though, and in reality, outside of load testing it, I have rarely seen it go over 30% usage. The more recent i5 and i7 processors can more or less be equal in most use cases.  i5 13/14600, i7 13/14700.This processor is still top-tier and will be for a few years to come. 12th gen i-series processors were a game-changer, the 13th-gen improved on them a bit with more e-cores, and the 14th-gen is looking like a stop-gap to the next big thing.You won't be disappointed; make sure to keep it cool.",the United States,6 May 2024,start new pc build sale built pc since change bit since thing run hot full load watch gamers nexus youtube pull solid watt run cinebench use arctic freezer mm thermal grizzly contact frame kryonaut load degree almost instantly without throttle drop immediately degree load stop ambient degree thing brutally fast though reality outside load test rarely see go usage recent processor less equal use case processor still top tier year come th gen series processor game changer th gen improve bit e core th gen look like stop gap next big thing disappointed make sure keep cool
